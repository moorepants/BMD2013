    abstract = "We present canonical linearized equations of motion for the Whipple bicycle model consisting of four rigid laterally symmetric ideally hinged parts: two wheels, a frame and a front assembly. The wheels are also axisymmetric and make ideal knife-edge rolling point contact with the ground level. The mass distribution and geometry are otherwise arbitrary. This conservative non-holonomic system has a seven-dimensional accessible configuration space and three velocity degrees of freedom parametrized by rates of frame lean, steer angle and rear wheel rotation. We construct the terms in the governing equations methodically for easy implementation. The equations are suitable for e.g. the study of bicycle self-stability. We derived these equations by hand in two ways and also checked them against two nonlinear dynamics simulations. In the century-old literature, several sets of equations fully agree with those here and several do not. Two benchmarks provide test cases for checking alternative formulations of the equations of motion or alternative numerical solutions. Further, the results here can also serve as a check for general purpose dynamic programs. For the benchmark bicycles, we accurately calculate the eigenvalues (the roots of the characteristic equation) and the speeds at which bicycle lean and steer are self-stable, confirming the century-old result that this conservative system can have asymptotic stability.",

    abstract = "The c. 1959 mathematical model for human operator control dynamics has been validated and extended to produce a practically complete mathematical description of manual control dynamics for single-loop systems. This model is essential to the analytical design of closed-loop man-machine systems, and it facilitates understanding of the human as a control device. An extensive number of selected experiments using 9 subjects, 4 forms of plant dynamics of general applicability, and 3 principal forcing functions, yielded definitive describing function data over a frequency range of two decades including system crossover. Models were constructed at three levels of detail: 1) a crossover model which is easily and usefully applied; 2) an extended crossover model which accounts more adequately for low frequency lags and plant dynamics; and 3) a precision model which provides a description so detailed that inferences can be drawn about neuromuscular functions. The resulting adaptive, optimalizing c. 1965 human operator mathematical model is presented, with a detailed summary of its adjustments for proper application.",
