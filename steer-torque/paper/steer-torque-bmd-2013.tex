\section*{Introduction}

To control a bicycle or motorcycle, the rider's primary means of directing the
vehicle is to apply forces to the handlebars which cause the front frame to
rotate relative to the rear frame. The rider can, of course, also use other
more subtle biomechanical motions to influence the motion of the vehicle,
especially the lighter-weight vehicles, but it is known that forces
applied to the handlebar give much more control authority than other means
regardless of the vehicle's inertia \cite{Sharp2007,Sharp2008a}.

From the modeling perspective, it is generally easier to model the interface
forces between the rider and the front frame as a single torque about the steer
axis which acts between the front frame and the rear frame. The rider can be
assumed to be part of the rear frame, regardless if the rider rigidity is an
assumption or not.

Due to this modeling assumption and ease of measurement most experimental
measurements of the interface forces between the rider and the front frame are
obtained by measuring the torque generated in the steer axis of the front
frame. These direct measurements of the rider applied steer torque are
susceptible to error from two major causes: (1) inertia effects of the front
frame which are located between the sensor and the rider's hands and (2) cross
talk from rider applied forces other than those which generate steer torque.
Accounting for the error sources are particularly important when the steer
torques are of low magnitude ($<$ 20 Nm or so).

In this paper we review previous methods of steer torque measurements in
bicycle and motorcycles throughout history and detail the design and
implementation of a bicycle steer torque measurement system which minimizes the
aforementioned cross talk errors. We then show the computations needed to
correctly compensate for inertial effects of the front frame and bearing
friction to obtain a more accurate estimate of the rider applied steer torque.
Finally, to show the necessity of this approach, we compare the error
between the uncompensated and compensated steer torque measurements for a large
set of bicycle experiments.

\section*{History of Steer Torque Measurements}

The earliest steer torque measurements were preformed by
\cite{Wilson-Jones1951} in 1951. Wilson-Jones developed a set of motorcycle
handlebars mounted in the rubber bushings that indicated the direction and
value of torque in an analog fashion in real time. He demonstrated that you
apply a negative torque with respect the steering angle to enter into a turn
and measured torques in normal maneuvers in the 4 to 14 Nm range. Not long
after this \cite{Kondo1955} was the first to record torque measurements on a
motorcycle for post experiment analysis. Work in Japan on motorcycle dynamics
grew considerably after World War II due to sanctions on aircraft research.
\cite{Kageyama1959} and \cite{Fu1965} continued to improve steer torque
measurements in motorcycles and studied further steady turning.
\cite{Eaton1973} was the first person to measure steer torque in the United
States during experiments. He attached a third handle bar above the regular
handlebars with strain gages that produced voltage proportional to the applied
torque around the steer axis. The rider operated the motorcycle with one hand.
He measured steer torques up to 3.4 Nm for straight riding during speeds of 15
to 30 mph. This led him to conclude that most of the steer torque was due to
rider remnant, as opposed to deliberate control. Not long after this,
\cite{Weir1979a} developed a modular torque sensor which could be affixed to
multiple motorcycles with a $\pm$ 70 Nm range and a 1\% accuracy with a 10 Hz
bandwidth. They were careful to reduce crosstalk from other forces applied to
the handlebars. They unfortunately oversized the sensor and the signal to noise
ratio was low for steady turn and straight riding maneuvers, but they measured
torques of -20 to 55 Nm in lane changes. \cite{Sugizaki1988} also measured steer
torque in high speed motorcycle lane change maneuvers and recorded torques
between -20 and 20 Nm.

After years of motorcycle steer torque measurements, the first bicycle
measurements were made by \cite{Lorenzo1997} on a downhill mountain bicycle
which was fitted with a custom strain gauged handlebar which could effectively
measure torque about the longitudinal axis and the vertical axis. His plot of
torque measurements show maximum steer torques of 7 Nm and maximum longitudinal
handlebar torques of 15 Nm which demonstrated that non-steer related forces on
the handlebars can be significantly higher that those needed for steering.

Around the turn of the century, \cite{Bortoluzzi2000} designed a motorcycle
steer torque transducer in which floating handlebars engage the fork through a
small strain gaged cantilever beam. This design was less susceptible to
crosstalk than earlier designs. They found torques to up to 20 Nm for slalom
maneuvers at 40 m/s. Around the same time, \cite{James2002} developed a
secondary handlebar with integrated load cell to measure steer torques in an
off road motorcycle.

In 2003, \cite{Cheng2003} completed a comprehensive study on bicycle steer
torque for an undergraduate project. Cheng started by simply attaching a torque
wrench to a bicycle and made left turns at speeds from 0 to 13 m/s and found
that most steering torques were under 5 Nm. He then designed a floating
handlebar which connected engaged the steer tube via a linear load cell. They
configured the load cell to measure 0 to 84 Nm. Cheng found torques up to 1 Nm
for steady turning at 4.5 m/s and up to 10 Nm for sharp turns. Confirming that
bicycles require much lower torques for maneuvering.

\cite{Iuchi2006} constructed a bicycle with a steer motor that ``senses'' the
rider's input and for additive control of steer torque. The rider applied steer
torque was estimated from the motor torque and the handlebar and motor moments
of inertia. \cite{Capitani2006} shows measured steer torques from an
instrumented scooter between -15 and 40 Nm. \cite{Evertse2010} may be the only
person to estimate steer torque from sensors in the handle grips of a
motorcycle that give force measurements directly at the human-vehicle
interface. During the test maneuvers, a maximum of 40 Nm was observed.
\cite{Teerhuis2010} shows measured torques just under 20 Nm for a motorcycle in
slalom maneuvers.

Recently, \cite{Cain2012} developed an in-the-steer tube torque sensor for a
bicycle. The measured steer torques in steady turns never exceed 2.4 Nm but he
admits that his sensor was 90\% oversized. And most recently, \cite{Ouden2011}
developed a steer torque sensor sensor that was susceptible to cross talk from
other handlebar loads but had an appropriate measurement range of $\pm7.5$ Nm.

Steering torque has been measured in relatively few instances of bicycle
experiments and not many more for motorcycles. Of these, very few of the
designs may actually measure the true rider applied steer torque. This is more
consequential for bicycles than motorcycles because the small torques used in
typical bicycle control are of the order of 5 Nm. \cite{Ouden2011}, in
particular, showed how sensitive the torque measurements are to other handlebar
loads. Also, most of these designs measure the torque somewhere between the
rider hands and the ground contact point. This is a physically ideal way to
measure the steer torque, but no one has accounted for the dynamic inertial
effects of the front frame above or below the sensor. \cite{Evertse2010} may be
the only design which mitigates this inertial compensation issue completely.

With this information in hand we designed a steer torque measurement system for
a bicycle that accounts for the deficients in previous designs mentioned above.

\section*{Isolated Steer Torque Measurement Design}

Our design is based around a Futek 150 in-lb ($\pm 17$ Nm) TFF350 torque sensor
to ensure high accuracy for the low torques used in normal bicycle maneuvering.
To guarantee that we only measured torque about the steer axis we isolated the
steer torque sensor from any of the non-axial torques and all forces
transmitted through the handlebar or ground contact with a zero backlash
telescoping double universal joint, Figure \ref{fig:steer-torque-design}. This
design ensured that the torque about the steer axis was the only load the
sensor detected.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/steer-torque-design.png}
  \caption{The steer torque sensor isolation design. The handlebars attach to
    the stem which is mounted in the upper bearings. The fork and steer tube
    are mounted in the normal headset of the bicycle. Between these two sets of
    bearing the stem is connected to the steer tube via the torque sensor and a
    zero backlash telescoping double universal joint. The steer angle and rate
    are measured at the steer tube and rate and acceleration of the rear frame
    are collected with the IMU.}
  \label{fig:steer-torque-design}
\end{figure}

\section*{Steer Dynamics}
\label{sec:steer-dynamics}

The final design measured the torque in the steer tube along the steer axis,
but this measured torque, $T_M$, is not the same as the effective input torque
applied by the rider. The rider applied steer torque, $T_\delta$, can be shown
to be a function of the kinematics of the front and rear frame and the friction
torques generated by the bearings.

A free body diagram can be drawn of the portion of the front frame assembly
above the torque sensor, Figure \ref{fig:handlebar-free-body}. The torques
acting on the handlebar about the steer axis are the measured torque, $T_M$,
the rider applied steer torque, $T_\delta$, and the friction from the upper
bearing set, $T_U$, which we describe by the sum of Coulomb, $T_{U_F}$, and
viscous friction, $T_{U_V}$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{figures/handlebar-free-body.pdf}
  \caption{A free body diagram of the handlebar, $G$, with all of the axial torques
    shown. The rear frame, $B$, is oriented with respect to the Newtonian
    reference frame $N$ in some arbitrary orientation. The handlebar rotates
    about $\hat{b}_3$ with respect to the rear frame. Gravity $g$ is in the
    $\hat{n}_3$ direction. The rider applies forces to the handlebars, of which
    there is a component torque $T_\delta$ about the steer axis. This torque is
    resisted by the upper bearing friction $T_U$, the measured torque at the
    sensor $T_M$, the inertia of the handlebar, and the gravitaional force
    acting on the handlebar center of mass $g_o$. The three distances, $d$,
    $d_s1$, and $d_s3$ locate the handlebar cetner of mass with respect to the
    center of the IMU.}
  \label{fig:handlebar-free-body}
\end{figure}

We measure three components of body fixed angular rate of the rear frame, $B$,
in the Newtonian reference frame $N$ with three rate gyros. This is described
by

\begin{equation} ^N\bar{\omega}^B = w_{b1}\hat{b}_1 + w_{b2}\hat{b}_2 +
  w_{b3}\hat{b}_3
  \label{eq:rear-frame-angular-rate}
\end{equation}

The handlebar, $G$, is connected to the bicycle frame, $B$, by a revolute joint
that rotates through the steering angle, $\delta$, and we measure a component
of the body fixed angular rate of the handlebar, $w_{h3}$ about the steer axis
with a rate gyro. The angular velocity of the handlebar can be written as
follows

\begin{equation}
  ^N\bar{\omega}^G = (w_{b1}c_\delta + w_{b2}s_\delta)\hat{g}_1 +
  (-w_{b1}s_\delta + w_{b2}c_\delta)\hat{g}_2 +
  w_{h3}\hat{g}_3
\end{equation}

where $c_\delta$ and $s_\delta$ are shorthand for $\operatorname{cos}(\delta)$
and $\operatorname{sin}(\delta)$ respectively.

The steer rate, $\dot{\delta}$, can be computed by subtracting the angular rate
of the bicycle frame about the steer axis from the angular rate of the
handlebar about the steer axis.

\begin{equation}
  \dot{\delta} = w_{h3} - w_{b3}
\end{equation}

Now we define a point, $s$, on the steer axis a minimum distance $d$ from the
center of mass of the handlebar, $g_o$.

\begin{equation}
  \bar{r}^{g_o/s} = d\hat{g}_1
\end{equation}

We also measure the body fixed acceleration of a point, $v$, on the bicycle
frame which includes the acceleration due to gravity.

\begin{equation}
  ^N\bar{a}^v = a_{v1}\hat{b}_1 + a_{v2}\hat{b}_2 + a_{v3}\hat{b}_3
\end{equation}

The location of point $v$ is known with respect to $s$

\begin{equation}
  \bar{r}^{s/v} = d_{s1}\hat{b}_1 + d_{s3}\hat{b}_3
\end{equation}

$^N\bar{a}^{g_o}$ can now be calculated using the two point theorem for
acceleration \cite{Kane1985} twice starting at the point $v$

\begin{equation}
  ^N\bar{a}^s = {}^N\bar{a}^v +
    {}^N\dot{\bar{\omega}}^B\times\bar{r}^{s/v} +
    {}^N\bar{\omega}^B\times({}^N\bar{\omega}^B\times\bar{r}^{s/v})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  ^N\bar{a}^{g_o} = {}^N\bar{a}^s +
    {}^N\dot{\bar{\omega}}^G\times\bar{r}^{g_o/s} +
    {}^N\bar{\omega}^G\times({}^N\bar{\omega}^G\times\bar{r}^{g_o/s})
\end{equation}

The angular momentum of the handlebar about its center of mass is

\begin{equation}
  ^N\bar{H}^{G/g_o} = I^{G/g_o} \cdot {}^N\bar{\omega}^G
\end{equation}

where $I^{G/g_o}$ is the inertia dyadic with reference to the center of
mass which exhibits symmetry about the 1-3 plane.

Now, the dynamic equations of motion of the handlebar can be written:
the sum of the torques on the handlebar about point $s$ is equal to the
derivative of the angular momentum of $G$ in $N$ about $g_o$ plus the
cross product of the vector from $s$ to $g_o$ with the mass times the
acceleration of $g_o$ in $N$ \cite{Meriam1975}

\begin{equation}
  \sum \bar{T}^{G/s} = {}^N\dot{\bar{H}}^{G/g_o} +
    \bar{r}^{g_o/s} \times m_G\,{}^N\bar{a}^{g_o}
\end{equation}

We are only interested in the components of the previous equation in
which the steer torque appears, so only the torques about the steer axis
are examined.

\begin{equation}
  \sum T^{G/s}_3 = T_\delta - T_U - T_M = \left({}^N\dot{\bar{H}}^{G/g_o} +
  \bar{r}^{g_o/s} \times m_G\,{}^N\bar{a}^{g_o}\right) \cdot \hat{g}_3
\end{equation}

Finally, $T_\delta$ can be written as

\begin{align}
  T_{\delta} =
    & I_{G_{22}} \left[ \left( -w_{b1} s_\delta + w_{b2} c_\delta \right)
      c_\delta + w_{b2} s_\delta \right] + I_{G_{33}} \dot{w}_{g3} + \nonumber \\
    & I_{G_{31}} \left[ (-w_{g3} + w_{b3} ) w_{b1} s_\delta +
      (-w_{b3} + w_{g3}) w_{b2} c_\delta +
      s_\delta \dot{w}_{b2} + c_\delta \dot{w}_{b1} \right] + \nonumber \\
    & \left[ I_{G_{11}} (w_{b1} c_\delta + w_{b2}s_\delta) +
      I_{G_{31}} w_{g3} \right] \left[-w_{b1} s_\delta +
      w_{b2} c_\delta \right] + \nonumber \\
    & d m_G \left[ d (-w_{b1} s_\delta + w_{b2} c_\delta)
      (w_{b1} c_\delta + w_{b2} s_\delta) + d \dot{w}_{g3} \right] - \nonumber \\
    & d m_G \left[-d_{s1} w_{b2}^{2} + d_{s3} \dot{w}_{b2} -
      (d_{s1} w_{b3} - d_{s3} w_{b1}) w_{b3} + a_{v1} \right] s_\delta + \nonumber \\
    & d m_G \left[d_{s1} w_{b1} w_{b2} + d_{s1} \dot{w}_{b3} +
      d_{s3} w_{b2} w_{b3} - d_{s3} \dot{w}_{b1} + a_{v2} \right]
      c_\delta + \nonumber \\
    & T_U + T_M
\end{align}

All of the time varying terms in $T_\delta$ are measured by the on-board
sensors or can be calculated with numerical differentiation except for the
upper bearing frictional torque, $T_U$. We estimate this torque contribution
through experiments described in the following section. The distance, mass, and
inertial values can be measured as described in \cite{Moore2012}.

\section*{Estimation of Bearing Friction}
\label{sec:bearing-friction}

In our design, the torque sensor is mounted between two sets of bearings. The
upper set for the handlebars are tapered roller bearings and the lower are
typical bicycle headset bearings. Each are preloaded a nominal amount during
installation. We assume that the rotary friction due to each bearing set can be
described as the sum of viscous $T_{Bv}$ and Coulomb friction $T_{Bc}$. The
Coulomb friction can be described as a piecewise function of the steering rate,
Equation \ref{eq:coulomb}, and viscous friction as a function linear in the
steer rate, Equation \ref{eq:viscous}.

\begin{equation}
  T_{Bc} = t_B \operatorname{sgn}(\dot\delta) =
  \begin{cases}
    t_B  & \textrm{if $\dot{\delta}>0$}\\
    0    & \textrm{if $\dot{\delta}=0$}\\
    -t_B & \textrm{if $\dot{\delta}<0$}
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:coulomb}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:viscous}
  T_{Bv} = c_B \dot{\delta}
\end{equation}

The total friction due to all of the bearings is

\begin{equation}
  T_B = T_{Bc} + T_{Bv}
\end{equation}

To estimate the coefficients $t_B$ and $c_B$, we mounted the bicycle such that
the steer axis was vertical, the front wheel was off the ground, and the rear
frame was rigidly fixed in inertial space. We then attached two springs of in
parallel stiffness $k$ to the left handlebar such that the force from the
springs acted on a lever arm, $l$, relative to the steer axis.

This configuration allowed us to apply small perturbations to the handlebars
and measure the damped vibrations in the steer angle, steer rate, and steer
tube torque. The equations of motion governing the system then become

\begin{equation}
  I_{HF} \ddot{\delta} + c_B \dot{\delta} + t_B
  \operatorname{sgn}(\dot{\delta}) + 2 k l^2 \delta = 0
\end{equation}

We measured the lever arm and spring stiffness as 0.213 meters and $904.7 \pm
0.6$ N/m respectively. The inertia of the handlebar, fork, and front wheel
about the steer axis, $I_{HF}$, was estimated based on the measurements
described in \cite{Moore2012} and found to be $0.1297+/-0.0005$ $kg\cdot m^2$

We estimated the friction coefficients with a non-linear grey box
identification based on the measured steer angle over 15 trials where the
steering assembly was perturbed from equilibrium. The identified viscous
coefficient is $c_B = 0.34 \pm 0.04$ $N \cdot m \cdot s^2$ and the Coulomb
coefficient is $t_B = 0.15 \pm 0.05$ $N \cdot m$.

To calculate the applied steer torque, $T_\delta$, we need an estimate of the
upper bearing friction, $T_U$. We made the simple assumption is that the
friction in the upper bearings equals the friction in the lower bearings, $T_U
= T_B / 2$ due to an inconclusive results from independently identifying the
upper and lower bearing friction, see \cite{Moore2012} for details.

\section*{Steer Torque Predictions}

Using the equations described in section \ref{sec:steer-dynamics} and the
estimates for the upper bearing friction in \ref{sec:bearing-friction} we
compute the compensated steer torque for 359 trials from the data collected
from the instrumented bicycle set presented in \cite{Moore1012}. Figure
\ref{fig:steer-torque-components} gives an example trial. We then compute the
root mean square of the error between the torque from the sensor and the
compensated torque for each trial. We also compute the maximum of the absolute
value of the error for each trial and the coefficient of determination
(i.e. $R^2$/VAF) between the compensated and uncompensated torques. Outliers
outside of $\pm2 \sigma$ were excluded from the results. Figure
\ref{fig:error-stats} shows the distribution of these statistics.

\section*{Discussion}

For the bicycle and maneuvers preformed in the experiments herein we have shown
that neglecting to compensate for inertial effects can a large influence on the
accuracy of the measurements. In particular, on median 28\% of the actual
torque applied by the rider is neglected. This may be less of a consequence for
motorcycles because the nominal steer torques are on mean much larger, but this
error will always be significant for measurements of low torque $<$ 20 Nm or so
in any vehicle. Steer torque sensor designs should account for the inertial
effects of the handlebars and eliminate crosstalk to keep the accuracy high.
Ideally one would measure the forces at the hand/handlebar interface with very
accurate six component load cells. The inertial compensation would ot be
necessary. But if more traditional direct steer torque measurements are used,
both cross talk and inertial compensation will be needed. We have only found a
couple designs that mitigate this issue before us. Maneuvers with high steer
accelerations and high handlebar axial moments of inertia are especially
susceptible.
