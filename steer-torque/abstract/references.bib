    review = "Supposedly measured handlebar torques. Has a really cool analog style of measuring steer torque. His motorcycle had an adjustable trail and head tube angle. Mentions that the steering geometry is such that the vehicle steers into the fall. Page 199 Holding a circular path there is positive torque of 3-4 ft-lb (4.1 - 5.4 Nm). Meaning you apply the torque in the same direction as the steer angle. When entering a bend you apply a negative torque with respect to the steer angle, positive torque when in the bend, and larger positive torque when coming out to the bend. He also notes that you push down and pull up on the handlebars when turning too.",
